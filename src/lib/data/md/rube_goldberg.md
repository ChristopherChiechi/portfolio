This rube goldberg machine was created over the course of two weeks using the LARC Engine and Box2d.  
The LARC Engine is a closed source engine created by Dr. Ian Parberry, but the documentation can be found [here](https://larc.unt.edu/code/engine/index.html).  
Box2d is an open source physics engine, and the documentation can be found [here](https://box2d.org/documentation/).
