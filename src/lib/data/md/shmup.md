*Uchugun* is a shoot 'em up game created over the course of about two months using the LARC Engine.  
This was the first game I made, and it is based on the Japanese arcade game *Ikaruga* developed by Treasure.  
The LARC Engine is a closed source engine created by Dr. Ian Parberry, but the documentation can be found [here](https://larc.unt.edu/code/engine/index.html).
