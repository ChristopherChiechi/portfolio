"C is a general-purpose programming language with features economy of expression, modern flow control
and data structures, and a rich set of operators. C is not a 'very high level' language, nor a 'big' one,
and is not specialized to any particular area of application. But its absence of restrictions and its
generality make it more convenient and effective for many tasks than supposedly more powerful
languages. C was originally designed for and implemented on the UNIX operating system on the DEC PDP-11, by
Dennis Ritchie." — Brian Kernighan & Dennis Ritchie

"Nothing better than C." — Linus Torvalds
